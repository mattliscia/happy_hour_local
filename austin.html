          <!-- Intro -->
          <section class="reveal">
            <p class="drop-cap">Austin doesn't really need a reason to drink. The city runs on creativity, live music, and a deep-seated belief that 3 PM on a Tuesday is a perfectly acceptable time to crack open a cold one. But the happy hour scene here isn't just about cheap drinks&mdash;it's about the experience. You're sipping half-price craft IPAs while a guy with a pedal steel guitar plays on a patio that used to be someone's backyard. You're eating $2 tacos at a bar that looks like it might fall down but has somehow been there since the '90s. Austin's happy hours are a vibe, and once you find your spots, you'll wonder why you ever paid full price for anything.</p>

            <h2>Happy Hours &amp; Drink Deals</h2>

            <h3>Best Overall Happy Hours</h3>
            <p>The gold standard in Austin happy hours hits that sweet spot of great drinks, solid food, and a patio you don't want to leave. Look for spots along South Congress that do half-price wells and local drafts from 3&ndash;6 PM weekdays. East Austin's warehouse-turned-bar scene delivers some of the most creative happy hour menus in the city&mdash;think $5 mezcal cocktails and $7 natural wine pours.</p>

            <h3>Craft Beer Specials</h3>
            <p>Austin is a craft beer town through and through. Most breweries along the East Side do some form of happy hour pricing, usually $1&ndash;2 off pints during weekday afternoons. The best move is brewery-hopping along the Metric Boulevard corridor or hitting the taprooms in the St. Elmo district. Several spots do "locals only" specials if you show a Texas ID&mdash;ask at the bar, it's rarely advertised.</p>
            <span class="deal-tag">$1-2 off pints</span>
            <span class="deal-tag">Brewery tours + tastings</span>

            <h3>Live Music Happy Hours</h3>
            <p>This is what makes Austin different from everywhere else. A handful of spots on East 6th and Red River do free live music during happy hour&mdash;we're talking actual talent, not some dude with an acoustic guitar butchering Wonderwall. Check the weekly lineups; some of the best emerging artists in Texas play these early sets to warm up before their headlining gigs.</p>

            <h3>Dive Bar Gems</h3>
            <p>Austin's dive bars are the real soul of the city. The ones that survived the development boom are the ones worth knowing. Cheap longnecks, no-frills atmosphere, and regulars who've been sitting on the same stool since before you were born. South Austin and North Loop still have the best concentration of genuine dives&mdash;look for the ones with no website and a parking lot full of pickup trucks.</p>

          <!-- Food & Dining Deals -->
          <hr class="section-divider">
          <section id="food-deals" class="reveal">
            <h2>Food &amp; Dining Deals</h2>

            <h3>Food Happy Hours</h3>
            <p>Austin's food happy hours are secretly some of the best dining deals in the state. Multiple spots along South Lamar and South First do half-price appetizers during happy hour, and we're not talking sad nachos&mdash;think smoked brisket sliders, fried avocado tacos, and elote with everything. Some of the nicer restaurants downtown run abbreviated happy hour menus that let you eat $40-plate food for $15.</p>

            <h3>Taco Specials</h3>
            <p>It's Austin, so tacos are basically their own food group. Breakfast taco happy hours are a thing here (yes, really), and several East Austin spots do $1.50&ndash;2 street-style tacos during afternoon hours. The trick is finding the truck parks that pair cheap tacos with cheap beer&mdash;there are at least a dozen good ones scattered across the east side.</p>
            <span class="deal-tag">$1.50 tacos</span>
            <span class="deal-tag">Half-price apps</span>

            <h3>Late Night Eats</h3>
            <p>After the bars close, Austin's late-night food scene takes over. Food truck parks along East 6th, South Congress, and the Drag near UT stay open until 2&ndash;3 AM on weekends. The late-night taco trucks are legendary, and several pizza-by-the-slice spots run post-midnight specials that keep the party going. Pro tip: the best late-night food is never on the main strip. Walk one block off the beaten path.</p>

          <hr class="section-divider">
          <section id="nightlife" class="reveal">
            <h2>Nightlife &amp; Events</h2>

            <h3>Key Entertainment Districts</h3>
            <p><strong>Dirty 6th:</strong> The famous strip. Loud, chaotic, mostly college kids and bachelorette parties. Fun if you're in the mood, skip it if you're not. <strong>East 6th:</strong> Where the locals actually go. Cocktail bars, indie venues, and bars with actual personality. <strong>Rainey Street:</strong> Converted houses turned into bars and restaurants. More upscale, great patios, solid food. Getting more corporate but still worth a visit. <strong>Red River Cultural District:</strong> The live music heart. Punk, rock, electronic, hip-hop&mdash;this is where Austin's music scene actually lives.</p>

            <h3>Weekly Events</h3>
            <p>Most bars have a weekly thing&mdash;Tuesday trivia is everywhere, Wednesday is typically industry night with steep discounts, and Thursday is when the weekend really starts. Several spots on Red River do free shows on weeknights. The farmers markets on Saturday mornings at Barton Creek and Sunday at the HOPE Farmers Market are great for day-drinking with fresh food.</p>

            <h3>Live Music</h3>
            <p>You already know Austin is the Live Music Capital. But beyond the headliners, the real magic is the random Tuesday night at a tiny venue where you stumble into the next big thing. Check the venues along Red River and East 6th for the best free and low-cover shows. During SXSW season, the whole city becomes one giant free concert&mdash;but the locals know the best showcases are the unofficial ones.</p>

            <h2>Daytime Activities</h2>

            <h3>Day Drinking Spots</h3>
            <p>Austin takes day drinking seriously. Barton Springs is the move in summer&mdash;swim in 68-degree spring water, then walk to one of the nearby beer gardens. Deep Eddy Pool has a similar vibe. The greenbelt trails pair perfectly with a post-hike beer at any of the South Lamar spots. Multiple rooftop bars downtown open at noon on weekends for brunch cocktails with skyline views.</p>

            <h3>Outdoor Activities</h3>
            <p>The Lady Bird Lake hike-and-bike trail is 10 miles of waterfront path perfect for running, biking, or just walking off last night's decisions. Kayak and paddleboard rentals are everywhere along the lake. Mount Bonnell is a short hike with the best view of the city. Zilker Park is basically Austin's backyard&mdash;festivals, frisbee, and food trucks year-round.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Attractions</h3>
            <p>The Blanton Museum of Art at UT is free on Thursdays. The Contemporary Austin has two locations with rotating exhibits worth checking out. South Congress is the iconic shopping and people-watching strip&mdash;vintage stores, boot shops, and galleries mixed with great food. The Cathedral of Junk in South Austin is the most Austin thing you'll ever see (call ahead, it's in someone's backyard).</p>

                <span class="vibe">Creative &amp; Buzzing</span>
                <p>The epicenter of Austin's food and drink scene right now. Converted warehouses, craft cocktail bars, excellent Mexican food, and breweries. Gentrifying fast, but still has edge. This is where you want to be.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="neighborhood-card">

                <span class="vibe">Upscale Patio Culture</span>
                <p>Historic bungalows turned into bars. Great for groups, patios are the main draw. Higher prices than East Austin but more polished. Weekends get packed&mdash;go on a Wednesday for the real vibe.</p>

              <div class="neighborhood-card">

                <p>The postcard version of Austin. Great for an afternoon stroll with stops for margaritas, tacos, and people-watching. Touristy but still charming. The side streets have hidden gems the main drag doesn't.</p>

                <span class="vibe">Food &amp; Drink Corridor</span>
                <p>An increasingly dense strip of restaurants, bars, and food trucks. Some of the best restaurant happy hours in the city. Less nightlife, more dining destination. The movie theater bars are a great date move.</p>

              <div class="neighborhood-card">
                <h4>Red River Cultural District</h4>
