            <p class="drop-cap">Houston is the city that other Texas cities don't give enough credit to. While Austin gets the hype and Dallas gets the glamour, Houston quietly built the most exciting food and drink scene in the state&mdash;maybe the whole South. The diversity here is staggering: you can eat Vietnamese pho for breakfast, Nigerian jollof rice for lunch, and wash it all down with a mezcal cocktail at a bar that would hold its own in New York or Mexico City. The happy hour scene benefits from this diversity in the best way possible. Cheap crawfish and cold beer at a Cajun joint, half-price sushi at a Japanese izakaya, $5 craft cocktails at a Montrose speakeasy. Houston rewards the adventurous drinker, and the best deals are in the neighborhoods most visitors never see.</p>

            <h2>Happy Hours &amp; Drink Deals</h2>

            <h3>Best Overall Happy Hours</h3>
            <p>Houston's happy hour game is aggressive in the best way. The competition for the after-work crowd is fierce, which means better deals for you. Washington Avenue and Midtown bars typically run 3&ndash;7 PM specials with $5&ndash;7 cocktails. But the real value is in the neighborhood spots throughout Montrose and the Heights, where independent bars do creative happy hour programs&mdash;think $4 negronis, half-price natural wine flights, and $3 local craft pints.</p>

            <h3>Cocktail Bar Specials</h3>
            <p>Houston's cocktail bar scene is nationally recognized and the happy hours at these spots are where you can drink world-class cocktails without the world-class price tag. Several acclaimed bars in Montrose and downtown do abbreviated happy hour menus with $8&ndash;10 cocktails that would be $16+ at regular hours. These are the same bartenders winning national competitions, making you a discounted drink. Take advantage.</p>
            <span class="deal-tag">$8 craft cocktails</span>
            <span class="deal-tag">Award-winning bars</span>

            <h3>Crawfish &amp; Beer Deals</h3>
            <p>When crawfish season hits (roughly February through June), Houston goes absolutely feral. Every neighborhood has spots running boil specials paired with cheap beer. The best deals are at the Vietnamese-Cajun spots along Bellaire Boulevard&mdash;the Viet-Cajun crawfish style that Houston invented and the rest of the country has been trying to copy. Expect $6&ndash;8 per pound with $2&ndash;3 beer specials during happy hour. Get there early during peak season; the good spots sell out.</p>
            <span class="deal-tag">$6/lb crawfish</span>
            <span class="deal-tag">$2 Lone Stars</span>

            <h3>Dive Bars</h3>
            <p>Houston's dive bars are legendary for a reason. Montrose has been a dive bar haven for decades, and while gentrification has claimed some, the survivors are institutions. Cheap beer, strong pours, cash-only (sometimes), and an atmosphere that money can't buy. The Heights and East End have great dives too&mdash;look for the ones with neon beer signs and limited online presence.</p>

            <h2>Food &amp; Dining Deals</h2>

            <h3>Food Happy Hours</h3>
            <p>Houston's restaurant happy hours are where the city's diversity really shines. Midtown and Montrose restaurants do half-price appetizer menus that read like a United Nations summit&mdash;Korean fried chicken, Salvadoran pupusas, Japanese yakitori, and Gulf Coast oysters all within walking distance of each other. Several EaDo (East Downtown) spots do $1 oyster happy hours that are genuinely excellent.</p>
            <span class="deal-tag">$1 oysters</span>
            <span class="deal-tag">Half-price apps</span>

            <h3>International Food Corridor</h3>
            <p>The stretch of Bellaire Boulevard through Chinatown is one of the great food destinations in America, and several restaurants there do afternoon deals. Hillcroft Avenue (the Mahatma Gandhi District) has incredible Indian and Pakistani food with lunch specials that extend into happy hour. The Long Point area has some of the best Korean food outside of Korea with soju specials to match. These aren't tourist spots&mdash;they're where Houston's immigrant communities eat, and the food is extraordinary.</p>

            <h3>Late Night Eats</h3>
            <p>Houston's late-night food scene runs deep. Chinatown stays open late with multiple spots serving until 2&ndash;3 AM. Montrose has late-night tacos, burgers, and the kind of 24-hour diners that attract everyone from club kids to night-shift workers. The Midtown food trucks come alive after midnight on weekends. And several Vietnamese pho spots are open 24 hours&mdash;the perfect hangover prevention strategy.</p>

            <h2>Nightlife &amp; Events</h2>

            <h3>Key Entertainment Districts</h3>
            <p><strong>Montrose:</strong> Houston's most eclectic neighborhood. LGBTQ+ bars, indie music venues, craft cocktail dens, and historic dives all within a few blocks. This is the cultural heart of Houston nightlife. <strong>Midtown:</strong> The young professional hub. More bars per square block than anywhere else in Houston. Accessible, affordable, and always busy. <strong>Washington Avenue:</strong> The going-out strip. Louder, more club-oriented, with large-format bars and sports viewing. <strong>EaDo (East Downtown):</strong> The emerging scene. Near the stadium district, with breweries, new restaurants, and a growing arts community.</p>

            <h3>Weekly Events</h3>
            <p>Houston's weekly events calendar is packed. Multiple Montrose bars do DJ nights mid-week. Midtown has bar crawl specials on Thursdays. The Heights hosts weekend farmers markets that pair perfectly with brunch drinks. Several bars do free comedy and open mic nights. During sports season, the bars near Minute Maid Park and Toyota Center run aggressive game-day specials.</p>

            <h3>Live Music &amp; Entertainment</h3>
            <p>Houston's music scene is deeper than most people realize. The hip-hop heritage runs strong, and multiple venues host emerging artists. Montrose has the best indie and electronic music venues. Last Concert Cafe in EaDo is a Houston institution for live Latin and roots music. The warehouse district hosts underground parties and art shows that feel like they belong in Brooklyn.</p>

            <h2>Daytime Activities</h2>

            <h3>Day Drinking Spots</h3>
            <p>Houston's beer gardens and patios are designed for all-day sessions. The Heights has multiple spots with huge outdoor areas, string lights, and afternoon drink specials. Buffalo Bayou Park is a stunning waterfront park downtown with food trucks and nearby bars. The brewery trail in EaDo and the Heights can fill an entire Saturday afternoon with tastings and patio time.</p>

            <h3>Outdoor Activities</h3>
            <p>Buffalo Bayou Park is Houston's crown jewel&mdash;160 acres of trails, art installations, and skyline views along the bayou. Hermann Park has the zoo, Japanese Garden, and Miller Outdoor Theatre (free performances). Memorial Park has some of the best urban trails in Texas. Yes, it's hot and humid, but the locals have figured out how to work around it: go early, find shade, and hydrate with beer.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Attractions</h3>
            <p>The Museum District has 19 museums, many of which are free. The Menil Collection is world-class and always free. The Rothko Chapel is a meditative masterpiece. NASA's Space Center Houston is a must. The mural scene in Montrose and EaDo rivals any city in the country. The Cistern at Buffalo Bayou is an underground art space in a repurposed drinking water reservoir&mdash;it's exactly as cool as it sounds.</p>

              <div class="neighborhood-card">
                <h4>Montrose</h4>
                <span class="vibe">Eclectic &amp; Essential</span>
                <p>The beating heart of Houston culture. LGBTQ+ history, the best bars in the city, incredible restaurants, and a neighborhood that fiercely protects its identity. If you only visit one Houston neighborhood, make it this one.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="neighborhood-card">
                <h4>Midtown</h4>
                <span class="vibe">Social &amp; Accessible</span>
                <p>Houston's most concentrated bar district. Something for everyone here&mdash;sports bars, cocktail lounges, hookah spots, and dance clubs. More affordable than Montrose, more diverse than Washington Ave. Great for a night out with a big group.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="neighborhood-card">
                <h4>The Heights</h4>
                <span class="vibe">Charming &amp; Laid-Back</span>
                <p>Historic bungalows, tree-lined streets, and a walkable strip of restaurants and bars along 19th Street and White Oak. More of a dinner-and-drinks vibe than a late-night scene. Great beer gardens, excellent brunch spots.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="neighborhood-card">
                <h4>EaDo (East Downtown)</h4>
                <span class="vibe">Emerging &amp; Raw</span>
                <p>Houston's fastest-changing neighborhood. Near the stadiums, with breweries, new restaurants, and live music venues popping up constantly. Still has a raw, industrial feel. Great for afternoon brewery hopping and game days.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="neighborhood-card">
                <h4>Chinatown / Bellaire</h4>
                <span class="vibe">Foodie Paradise</span>
                <p>Houston's sprawling Chinatown along Bellaire Boulevard is one of the best food destinations in America. Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, Malaysian&mdash;the variety is staggering. Not a typical "going out" district but the food happy hours and karaoke bars are unbeatable.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="neighborhood-card">
                <h4>Washington Avenue</h4>
                <span class="vibe">Loud &amp; Lively</span>
                <p>The main going-out strip for the weekend crowd. Larger venues, louder music, and a more high-energy scene. Good sports bars and large-format bars for big groups. Not for the quiet-drink-at-a-small-bar crowd, but fun when you're in the mood.</p>
