            <p class="drop-cap">San Antonio is the most underrated drinking city in Texas, and honestly, the locals like it that way. While tourists pack the River Walk restaurants paying $14 for a mediocre margarita, the real San Antonio is a few blocks away&mdash;in the historic cantinas that have been serving the neighborhood for generations, in the Pearl District wine bars that rival anything in Austin, and in the Southtown galleries where the art openings come with free beer and better conversation. SA is also the most affordable city in the Texas Triangle, which means your dollar stretches further at happy hour. The margaritas are legitimately the best in the state (fight us), the Tex-Mex is the original article, and the pace is just slow enough that you can actually enjoy your drink without someone trying to sell you a VIP table.</p>

            <h2>Happy Hours &amp; Drink Deals</h2>

            <h3>Best Overall Happy Hours</h3>
            <p>San Antonio happy hours start early and go long. Multiple spots across the Pearl District and Southtown run 2&ndash;6 PM specials on weekdays, with some extending to 7 PM. The prices here are noticeably lower than Austin or Dallas&mdash;$5 gets you a solid margarita, $4 gets you a local craft beer, and $6 gets you a well-made cocktail. The Broadway corridor from the Pearl down to downtown has the highest concentration of good happy hour spots.</p>

            <h3>Margarita Specials</h3>
            <p>San Antonio doesn't mess around with margaritas. This is where the frozen margarita machine was invented, and the city takes that heritage seriously. The best margarita happy hours are at the family-owned Tex-Mex spots scattered throughout the West Side and Southtown&mdash;fresh-squeezed lime, quality tequila, and prices that rarely exceed $5 during happy hour. Skip the River Walk tourist bars charging $12 for sugar water and find the real ones. Ask any local for their spot; everyone has a strong opinion.</p>
            <span class="deal-tag">$5 fresh margs</span>
            <span class="deal-tag">Frozen marg capital</span>

            <h3>Historic Cantinas</h3>
            <p>San Antonio's cantina culture is something no other Texas city can touch. Several bars on the West Side and near the Market Square area have been operating for 50+ years&mdash;some much longer. These aren't themed experiences or nostalgia plays. They're living, breathing community institutions where three generations of the same family might be sitting at the bar on any given Friday. Cold beer, strong drinks, and stories on the walls that you can't buy. Many do simple, no-frills happy hour specials: cheap beer, cheap shots, no pretension.</p>

            <h3>Wine &amp; Craft Cocktails</h3>
            <p>The Pearl District has transformed San Antonio's wine and cocktail scene. Several excellent wine bars do half-price bottles on certain weeknights. The craft cocktail bars in Southtown and the Pearl hold their own against any city's&mdash;and the happy hour prices make them genuinely accessible. Texas Hill Country wines feature prominently and are worth trying if you haven't.</p>

            <h2>Food &amp; Dining Deals</h2>

            <h3>Food Happy Hours</h3>
            <p>San Antonio food happy hours lean heavily into Tex-Mex and Mexican cuisine, and that's not a complaint. Half-price queso, discounted enchilada plates, and $2 street tacos are common across the city. The Pearl District restaurants do more upscale happy hour food&mdash;think discounted charcuterie, local oysters, and small plates from James Beard-nominated chefs at prices that won't break the bank.</p>

            <h3>Tex-Mex &amp; Mexican Food</h3>
            <p>This is San Antonio's culinary identity, and the depth of the scene is remarkable. From the puffy taco spots that have been here forever to the modern Mexican restaurants doing elevated takes on traditional dishes, the range is enormous. The West Side has the most authentic, family-owned spots with the best prices. Southtown has the creative fusion places. Both are worth exploring, and the happy hour deals at either are hard to beat anywhere in Texas.</p>

            <span class="deal-tag">Half-price queso</span>

            <h3>Late Night Eats</h3>
            <p>San Antonio's late-night food scene centers around the St. Mary's Strip and downtown. 24-hour taco joints are scattered throughout the city, and several are genuine institutions. The food trucks along St. Mary's and near the Pearl stay open late on weekends. For the best late-night experience, hit the taco spots on the West Side&mdash;they've been feeding the after-hours crowd since before late-night food was trendy.</p>

            <h2>Nightlife &amp; Events</h2>

            <h3>Key Entertainment Districts</h3>
            <p><strong>St. Mary's Strip:</strong> The punk rock heart of San Antonio. Dive bars, live music venues, and the kind of gritty energy that Austin's Red River used to have. This is where the locals go on weeknights. <strong>Southtown / Blue Star:</strong> Art galleries, wine bars, and restaurants with a more refined but still approachable vibe. First Friday art walks are a must. <strong>Pearl District:</strong> The upscale anchor. Excellent restaurants, craft cocktail bars, and a weekend farmers market that's one of the best in Texas. <strong>The River Walk:</strong> See our honest guide below&mdash;there are gems if you know where to look.</p>

            <h3>The River Walk: An Honest Guide</h3>
            <div class="pull-quote">Most of the River Walk is a tourist trap. But the parts that aren't are genuinely magical.</div>
            <p>Here's the truth: the main commercial stretch of the River Walk between the major hotels is overpriced and underwhelming. The restaurants are mediocre and the margaritas are weak. But&mdash;and this is important&mdash;the Museum Reach extension north toward the Pearl is beautiful, quieter, and lined with better bars and restaurants. The Mission Reach south is stunning for walking and cycling. And a few of the bars on the quieter bends of the main stretch are actually great if you know which ones. The trick is to walk past the places with barkers outside and find the ones with locals sitting at the bar.</p>

            <h3>Weekly Events &amp; Live Music</h3>
            <p>First Friday in Southtown is the main cultural event&mdash;galleries open, the streets fill up, and the bars run specials. St. Mary's Strip has live music most nights of the week. The Tobin Center downtown brings bigger acts. Fiesta San Antonio in April is one of the biggest festivals in Texas&mdash;the whole city becomes a party for 11 days. Market Square hosts regular events with mariachi, folkl&oacute;rico, and free music.</p>

            <h2>Daytime Activities</h2>

            <h3>Day Drinking Spots</h3>
            <p>The Pearl District farmers market on Saturday mornings is the perfect start to a day-drinking session&mdash;grab breakfast, get a morning cocktail or local beer, then wander the shops. The Museum Reach stretch of the River Walk is great for a daytime stroll with a stop at one of the riverside bars. Southtown has several spots with great patios for afternoon drinks. San Antonio's slower pace makes day drinking feel less rushed than in other cities.</p>

            <h3>Outdoor Activities</h3>
            <p>The San Antonio Missions are a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most historically significant sites in the country. You can bike or walk between all five missions on the Mission Reach trail. Brackenridge Park is a massive urban park with the San Antonio Zoo, Japanese Tea Garden (free admission), and beautiful trails. The greenway trail system is expanding and connects multiple parks throughout the city. Natural Bridge Caverns is a quick drive north for something completely different.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Attractions</h3>
            <p>The Alamo is obligatory, but the real history is at the other four missions. The McNay Art Museum is housed in a gorgeous Spanish Colonial mansion and is worth the trip for the building alone. The San Antonio Museum of Art has an excellent Latin American art collection. The DoSeum is great if you have kids. Market Square (El Mercado) is the largest Mexican market in the US and is a genuine cultural experience, not just a tourist one.</p>
